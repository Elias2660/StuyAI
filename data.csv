Python Basics,October,1,Python Crash Course Lesson 1,"Write and invoke a function, nameOrganizer, that takes in your first name and last name, outputting your full name.",This is simple string concatenation!  Adding two strings together results in a combination.,"def nameOrganizer(firstName, lastName):\n\treturn firstName + ' ' + lastName\n\nfullName = nameOrganizer('Elias', 'Xu')\n# Expecting Elias Xu\nprint(fullName)","def nameOrganizer(lastName, firstName):\n\tfullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName\n\treturn fullName\n\n# Expecting Daniel Elliot\nprint(nameOrganizer('Elliot', 'Daniel'))","No Third Solution"
Python Basics,October,1,Python Crash Course Lesson 1,"Write a function and its invocation that divides two numbers and prints the difference between its quotient and remainder","The floor division operator (//) performs division and rounds the quotient down to the nearest whole number. The modulus operator (%) performs division and returns the remainder","def quotientMinusRemainder(dividend, divisor):\n\treturn dividend // divisor - dividend % divisor)\n\n# Expecting -1\nquotientMinusRemainder(13, 5)","def quotientMinusRemainder(dividend, divisor):\n\tanswer = dividend // divisor\n\tremainder = dividend % divisor\n\treturn answer - remainder\n\n# Expecting -1\nprint(quotientMinusRemainder(13, 5))",No Third Solution
Python Basics,October,1,Python Crash Course Lesson 1,"Write a faulty Python program that defines variable foo = 12 and invokes print(foo). However, the print invocation should result in an error, stating that foo is undefined","If you constrain a variable to its local scope, it cannot be accessed outside of said scope","def foonction():\n\tfoo = 12\n\treturn foo\n\n# Expecting ERROR\nprint(foo)","#Expecting ERROR\nprint(foo)\n\nfoo = 12",No Third Solution
